## Guidelines

- Open an issue first for larger changes so we can agree on scope.
- Keep changes focused and include a brief explanation in the PR description.
- Update documentation when CLI flags or behavior change.
- If you add new features, include a short "How to test" note in the PR.

## Development setup

1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate it: `. .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Reporting issues

Please include your OS, WSL version, camera model, and any relevant logs.
